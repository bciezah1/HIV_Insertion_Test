This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of HIV integration sites. The structure of the repository is organized as follows:

## Repository Structure


## Folders

### `input/`
This folder contains a file (`README.txt`) that explains where the input data can be found and how it should be structured.

### `output/`
All the results from running the analysis scripts are saved in the `results/` folder.

### `code/`
The `code` folder is divided into two subfolders, one for Python scripts and one for R scripts. Each folder contains scripts that can be run to generate the output data.

- **python/**: Contains Python scripts.
